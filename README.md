# A Sinister Time
A game that is created within 2 weeks for my school game jam.

In this game, you are teleported to the past as you have sinned.
In order to prove yourself worthy of mortality, you must fight through time to the present.

Test the nightly version on the web here! [Link to Game](https://sinistertime.sourceforge.io/) 
Alternatively, you can download pre 1.0 releases from [here](https://github.com/sherlockholmestech/Game-Jam-2022/tags) 
Daily nightly builds are available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sinistertime/files/Daily%20Nightly%20Builds/) 

**NOTICE:  IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE THE WEB VERSION FOR THE FINAL RELEASE DUE TO POOR PERFORMANCE.**
